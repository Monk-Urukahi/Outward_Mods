# Mana Overhaul

**by Monk_Urukhai | [My Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/34353220?tab=user+files) | [My GitHub](https://github.com/Monk-Urukahi/Outward_Mods)**

Simple mod which changes how much mana is gained by sacrificing health and stamina at the Ley Line from 20 per 1 point to 5 per 1 point. (e.g for every 5 points you sacrifice of health and stamina, you now gain 5 mana instead of 20).

I wouldn't have been able to complete this mod without the advice and timely help of [OutlanderSinai](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/users/68319717).
