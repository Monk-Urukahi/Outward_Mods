# Elemental Discharge Removal

**by Monk_Urukhai | [My Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/34353220?tab=user+files) | [My GitHub](https://github.com/Monk-Urukahi/Outward_Mods)**

Simple mod which removes your weapon's imbue after using the Elemental Discharge skill sold by Eto. This is done as an attempt to balance it since Gong Strike has this effect as well.

I wouldn't have been able to complete this mod without the advice and timely help of [OutlanderSinai](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/users/68319717).
